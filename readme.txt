-- to do

 create pages for each film or each director (either way 8-10 in total)

 picture gallery - we use a jquery plugin for this

 subscribe to our news letter form
 	include a wysiwyg in form


insert dropdown menu in nav bar

when done, host site at gabe's amazon server, so people can test it on their phones

time line with the directors, each node in the time line can have a picture, summary, name of the film and name of the director

use accordion for :
	summary
	about director
	main cast

create wishlist button for each film .This might require the use of databases which we did not learn yet. 

play some iconic scene on the index page




		CALL FILMS ARRAY, AND THAT RESPONSIVENESS LINE IN THE INDEX.
